# Why You Should Use Whatever Code Editor Fits Your Needs

### I use whatever I like - and here's why you should use it too.
Because you are awesome and free to choose.
Because everyone is different: with different abilities, different mental concepts, and different needs.
And most of all, because alternatives exist.

### Why is it better?
Because totalitarian regimens suck!
Because we are different!

### Hey, ^(man|woman)$ - you know nothing! What you use is ugly, and slow, and clunky ðŸ˜  Plus it has no $FEATURE. And sometimes it won't let me $THE_WAY_I_LIKE. I need $SOME_HDI. I like my text editors as I like my games: first person shooters ðŸ”«
Ok! Please choose whatever you like! It's really ok.

### I bet you're a no lifer anyway who's got no friends because all the efforts into nurturing and caring for a relationship go towards your stupid $IDE.
Noâ€¦? I think you are awesome. Now go write some code!
